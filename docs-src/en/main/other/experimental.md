# Experimental Features

This is an experimental feature and may change in future versions.

## experimental.scrollY <Badge type="tip" text="^0.10.0" />

Transform-based vertical scrolling simulation.

Due to browser limitations on DOM element height, displaying extremely large datasets may cause issues. Using transform to simulate scrolling resolves this problem.

### Usage

```js
<template>
  <StkTable
    virtual
    scroll-row-by-row
    :experimental="{ scrollY: true }" //[!code ++]
    :data-source="dataSource"
    :columns="columns"
  />
</template>
```
